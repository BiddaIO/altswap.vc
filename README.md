# Uniswap vs Altswap

We only removed the commits related to [this](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1418697012095164420).

And on top of that, some small brand changes so we don't violate any trademarks policies.

Uniswap guys are putting much effort into their product, but unfortunately, they can't keep up to the promise of a fully decentralized exchange in some aspects.

All other links are pointing to the original Uniswap website to make sure it's continuously updated.
